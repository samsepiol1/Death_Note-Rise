# Death Note - Rise of New God

A game I developed using a browser game engine called Monogatari which is used to build Novel Games style games. The engine is based on the Javascript programming language and is highly customized for building dialogs and interacting with the characters.

## Personagem Principal
Minoru Tanaka is a character in the manga and anime Death Note. He is a high school student who finds one of the death notebooks that Kira (Light Yagami's alias) used earlier. Unlike Light, who used the notebook to try to create a crime-free world, Minoru sees the opportunity to earn money from the notebook.

Minoru is a character who is ambitious and cunning, but he is also impulsive and often acts without thinking of the consequences. He is a shrewd businessman, who uses the death notebook to eliminate his competitors and expand his business empire. However, he underestimates the danger the notebook poses and is eventually caught by the police.

While an interesting character, Minoru plays a relatively small role in the overall plot of Death Note, only appearing in a few episodes in the anime and in a few parts of the manga. He is an example of how the pursuit of power can corrupt even those who initially had good intentions.
